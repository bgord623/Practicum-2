# Overview
For this project I’ll be working with Tesla stock market data. The goal of the project is to utilize machine learning for categorical predictions. These predictions will ideally indicate the direction of a given stock before the trading day begins.
Data will be obtained, cleaned/processed, EDA & visualization will be performed, ML models will be utilized, performance analysis will take place, and finally the strategy will be implemented. 
I will review various strategies, then use machine learning techniques to make predictions.
