# Project details
For this project I’ll be working with stock market datasets. The goal of the project is to utilize machine learning for categorical predictions. These predictions will ideally indicate the direction of a given stock before the trading day begins.
Data will be obtained, cleaned/processed, EDA & visualization will be performed, ML models will be utilized, performance analysis will take place, and finally the strategy will be implemented. 
I plan to review simple moving average, momentum, and mean reversion strategies, then use machine learning (classification & deep learning) to make predictions
